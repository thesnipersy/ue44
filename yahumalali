#<
Design a controller for turn signals. There are is a left and a right turn
signal. The left signal is activated and deactivated by the "l" key. The right
signal is activated and deactivated by the "r" key. An active signal light
should blink at a rate of 1 Hz (500 ms on, 500 ms off). At most one signal may
be active at any one time.

There are two main functions to implement. The key-press function is called
whenever a key is pressed. The tick function is called at a rate of 60 Hz and
asks for the next state given the current state. Follow a design recipe and
think about tests cases first (key-press-test, tick-test). You also need to
set the initial state and implement the helper functions left-light-on? and 
right-light-on?.
